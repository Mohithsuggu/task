For **Task 2: Data Cleaning**, after merging all the data into a single DataFrame, here are the common challenges you may encounter and how to clean the data, specifically focusing on the `photo_urls` column:

### **Common Data Cleaning Challenges üõ†Ô∏è:**
1. **Missing or Null Values**:  
   - Missing or `NaN` values in critical columns like `photo_urls`, `property_id`, `rent`, `locality`, etc., need to be handled.
   - These missing values can either be filled with appropriate values, dropped, or imputed based on the context.

2. **Inconsistent Data Formats**:  
   - Data columns like dates (`activation_date`), numbers (`rent`, `property_size`), and categories (`furnishing`, `lease_type`) might have inconsistent formats.
   - This includes extra spaces, non-standard date formats, or mixed value types (e.g., numerical and categorical in the same column).

3. **Duplicate Rows**:  
   - The dataset may contain duplicate property entries after merging the CSVs. Identifying and removing these is important to avoid skewing analysis.

4. **Corrupted or Invalid Data**:  
   - The `photo_urls` column, specifically, might contain corrupted JSON-like strings or malformed data. You need to clean this data to extract meaningful information (e.g., the number of photos).

### **Cleaning the `photo_urls` Column üåê:**

The `photo_urls` column likely contains corrupted JSON-like strings that need to be cleaned to extract the number of photos for each property.

Here‚Äôs how you can clean and extract the `photo_count`:

#### **Steps to Clean and Extract `photo_count`:**

1. **Inspect the `photo_urls` Column:**
   - Before cleaning, examine the structure of the data in the `photo_urls` column to understand how the data is stored (e.g., malformed JSON or a list of URLs).

```python
# Check the first few entries of the photo_urls column
print(combined_df['photo_urls'].head())
```

2. **Handle Corrupted JSON or List-Like Data:**
   - If the `photo_urls` column contains strings that look like malformed JSON, you can attempt to parse them and extract the number of URLs.

```python
import ast

def extract_photo_count(photo_urls):
    try:
        # Attempt to convert the string to a list if it's in a corrupted JSON format
        photo_list = ast.literal_eval(photo_urls)  # Convert string to a list
        return len(photo_list)  # Return the number of photos
    except (ValueError, SyntaxError, TypeError):
        # If it's not valid, return 0 (no photos)
        return 0

# Apply this function to the photo_urls column to create the photo_count column
combined_df['photo_count'] = combined_df['photo_urls'].apply(extract_photo_count)
```

3. **Handle Missing or Null Values in `photo_urls`:**
   - For properties where `photo_urls` is missing or null, set the `photo_count` to 0.

```python
# Fill NaN or missing values in photo_urls with 0 photos
combined_df['photo_count'] = combined_df['photo_count'].fillna(0)
```

4. **Verify and Clean Data Types:**
   - Ensure the `photo_count` column is of the correct numerical type (e.g., integer).

```python
# Ensure the photo_count is of integer type
combined_df['photo_count'] = combined_df['photo_count'].astype(int)
```

5. **Check for Inconsistencies in `photo_urls`:**
   - After applying the cleaning function, verify that the `photo_count` reflects realistic values (e.g., not negative or excessively large).

```python
# Check for properties with negative or unusually large photo_count
print(combined_df[combined_df['photo_count'] < 0])
print(combined_df[combined_df['photo_count'] > 100])  # If photos > 100 is unusual
```

### **Other Data Cleaning Steps to Consider:**

1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - If other columns have missing or null values (e.g., `rent`, `property_size`, `furnishing`), decide on the best approach to fill or remove them. Common methods include:
     - **Fill with a placeholder or default value** (e.g., `0` for numeric columns, `'Unknown'` for categorical).
     - **Drop rows with critical missing data** if it‚Äôs not feasible to impute them.

```python
# Example: Fill missing rent values with median
combined_df['rent'] = combined_df['rent'].fillna(combined_df['rent'].median())
```

2. **Ensuring Consistent Data Formats:**
   - For date columns like `activation_date`, make sure all values are in the correct datetime format.
   - For categorical columns like `furnishing`, ensure consistent spelling and capitalization.

```python
# Convert activation_date to datetime format
combined_df['activation_date'] = pd.to_datetime(combined_df['activation_date'], errors='coerce')

# Ensure categorical columns like 'furnishing' have consistent values
combined_df['furnishing'] = combined_df['furnishing'].str.strip().str.lower()
```

3. **Removing Duplicate Rows:**
   - After merging, check for duplicate property listings (e.g., multiple entries for the same `property_id`) and remove them.

```python
# Remove duplicates based on property_id
combined_df = combined_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['property_id'])
```

### **Conclusion:**
After performing the above steps, your `photo_count` will be properly extracted, and the data will be cleaned for analysis. The `photo_urls` column will be converted into a more meaningful `photo_count` feature, and any missing, invalid, or duplicate data will be handled appropriately.
